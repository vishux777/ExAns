Troubleshooting

Extension Not Responding: Ensure the webpage has fully loaded before double-clicking. Try refreshing the page.
Content Not Displaying: Some websites with strict Content Security Policies (CSP) may interfere with the extension. Test on a different webpage (e.g., a Wikipedia article) to confirm functionality.
Partial Content Display: If the displayed content is cut off, the response might be too long for the current display window. This is a known limitation.
