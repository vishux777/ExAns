Method: Double-Click Trigger

The extension will analyze the page content and display the answer.

Answer Display Methods
The extension uses various discreet methods to show answers:

Overlay: A small window appears in the top-right corner of the page.
Tooltip: A tooltip appears near your mouse cursor.
Console: The answer is printed to the browser's developer console (press F12 to view).
Notification: A browser notification shows the answer.
Canvas: A canvas element appears in the bottom-right corner of the page.

The display method is randomly selected each time to avoid detection patterns.
Toggling the Extension
To toggle the extension on or off:

Press Ctrl+Shift+S (or Command+Shift+S on Mac) while on any webpage.
A notification will confirm whether the extension is enabled or disabled.

Troubleshooting

If the extension doesn't respond to triggers, try refreshing the page.

Make sure the page has fully loaded before attempting to use the extension.
Some websites with strict Content Security Policies may interfere with the extension's functionality.
If the extension appears disabled, press Ctrl+Shift+S to toggle it and check the console for errors.
